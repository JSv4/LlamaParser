# LlamaParser

![llama_parse.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fllama_parse.png)

LlamaParser is a (very much work in progress) tool to harness the power of LLMs to 
parse structural information from documents using LLMs (e.g. tables, sections, paragraphs, etc.). This is particularly 
necessary for a lot of complex formats like docx and pdf that are not readily converted to structured data.
